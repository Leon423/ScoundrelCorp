# ScoundrelCorp
 A RogueCompany style shooter prototype originally meant to be built over a week but things got in the way so now I just work on it when I can. Primarily created to learn more about networking a game.
 
 # Current Plans
 Two Characters: Dallas and someone undecided
 One Weapon Each: May do two weapons if I have time, want to focus on more important aspects of the game.
 Abilities: Get core abilities of characters down (Dallas snap for example)
 
 # If I can find art that works
 Dodge Roll: Coding this should be straight forward, but not sure if I can make or find an animation for it.
 
 # If time allows
 Add Juice: Hitmarkers, sounds, etc.
