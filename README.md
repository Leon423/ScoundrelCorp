# ScoundrelCorp
 A RogueCompany style shooter prototype. Primarily created to learn more about networking a game. Haven't had too much time to work on it lately, but will continue to add features and fix issues. (Really need to find a better way to replicate shots over the network, right now if the shot has the same start and end point as the last show then it doesn't draw the effect)
 
 # Current Plans
 Two Characters: Dallas and someone undecided
 One Weapon Each: May do two weapons if I have time, want to focus on more important aspects of the game.
 Abilities: Get core abilities of characters down (Dallas snap for example)
 
 # If I can find art that works
 Dodge Roll: Coding this should be straight forward, but not sure if I can make or find an animation for it.
 
 # If time allows
 Add Juice: Hitmarkers, sounds, etc.
